**Edge Deployer** is a native Electron-based IDE that lets developers write, preview, and deploy serverless APIs to **Cloudflare**, **AWS Lambda**, and **Vercel** — no CLI, YAML, or credential juggling required.

---

## 🔥 Why Edge Deployer?

Modern cloud deployments are powerful — but bloated. They assume terminal fluency, deep IaC knowledge, and tons of boilerplate. Edge Deployer fixes that:

- ✅ Monaco code editor with live preview
- ✅ Deploy to multiple cloud platforms with 1 click
- ✅ Export real IaC configs via Pulumi
- ✅ See deployment logs and live API responses — in the same app

> A devtool built for people who want to deploy without wasting time on devops overhead.

## 🧠 Key Features

### 🖥️ Live Code Editing + Preview
- VSCode-style Monaco editor
- Auto language detection for `.ts`, `.js`, `.json`
- Drag-and-drop file upload with toast confirmation
- Secure preview iframe that:
  - Runs your handler with fetch()
  - Displays `console.log` output
  - Returns ✅ 200 OK or ❌ error

### ☁️ One-Click Multi-Cloud Deploy
- Configurable cloud targets: Cloudflare, AWS Lambda, Vercel
- Credentials stored via localStorage
- Status shown with spinner and status bar
- Deploy history shows last 5 with timestamp + cloud

### 📟 Real-Time Logs + Testing
- IPC-connected deploy logs streamed from Electron
- Live API tester: Send POST/GET to deployed function
- API logs panel shows response, status, timestamp, and body

### 📦 Pulumi IaC ZIP Export
- Instantly generate:
  - `Pulumi.yaml`
  - `tsconfig.json`
  - `index.ts` handler
- Pulumi-compatible: run `pulumi up` in terminal if needed

├── multiCloudDeployer.ts   ← Routes deploys to Cloudflare, AWS, Vercel
├── generatePulumiCloudflare.ts ← Generates full IaC project ZIP
│
└── Renderer (React + TypeScript)
    ├── MonacoEditor.tsx         ← Rich drag-and-drop code editor
    ├── Preview.tsx              ← Sandboxed iframe previewer
    ├── DeployLogPanel.tsx       ← Color-coded logs streamed via IPC
    ├── TestPanel.tsx            ← Live HTTP request interface
    ├── DeployHistoryPanel.tsx   ← View and relaunch past deploys
    └── ConfigModal.tsx          ← Cloud credentials + project config form
```

## 🧪 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

```bash
# 1. Clone and run locally
git clone https://github.com/mansoor-mamnoon/edge-deployer
cd edge-deployer
npm install
npm run dev
```

```md
2. Then inside the app:
- 💡 Write or paste your JavaScript serverless handler
- ▶️ Click "Run" to preview the response
- ☁️ Click "Deploy" to your chosen cloud (Cloudflare by default)
- 🔗 Get the URL and open it live in browser
- 📟 Watch real-time logs stream in
- 🧪 Test POST/GET API calls in-app with any payload
- 📥 Download a Pulumi-based ZIP to deploy manually or commit to Git
```

## 📤 Output Example

```ts
// Deployed Function
addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});

async function handleRequest(request) {
  return new Response("Hello from your deployed API!", {
    headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain" },
  });
}
```

```yaml
# Generated Pulumi.yaml
name: edge-worker
runtime: nodejs
description: Cloudflare worker generated by Edge Deployer
```

```ts
// index.ts for Pulumi
import * as cloudflare from "@pulumi/cloudflare";

export const worker = new cloudflare.WorkerScript("my-worker", {
  name: "my-worker",
  content: `...`,
});
```
